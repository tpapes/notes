                <p>
                    Kosaraju's Algorithm finds the strongly connected components 
                    in a directed graph. 
                </p>
                <h2>
                    The Algorithm:
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        let L be an empty stack.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        for each vertex u in the graph, if u is not visited, 
                        do Visit(u), where Visit(u) is described as follows:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                mark u as visited
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                for each vertex v at an outbound edge of u, 
                                if v is not visited, do Visit(v)
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                prepend u to L
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        At this point, we will have recursively prepended each vertex to L 
                        in post-order, meaning that no vertex can have an edge 
                        pointing to a vertex to its left. 
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        for each vertex u in L, if u is not connected, 
                        do Connect(u, u), where Connect(u, root) is described as follows:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                mark u as connected
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                set the representative node of the component to root
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                for each vertex v at an <i>inbound</i> edge of u,
                                if v is not connected, do Connect(v, root)
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        At this point, all vertices will have a representative root, where
                        all vertices in the same component share the same root.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This algorithm, in essence,  searches for groups of vertices that are connected 
                    both forwards and backwards, and gives them the same representative.

                    It does this in a somewhat roundabout way though.
