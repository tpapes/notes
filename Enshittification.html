                <h1>Enshittification</h1>
                <p>
                    A term coined by Cory Doctorow to describe the process 
                    of online platforms making the internet less attractive 
                    and useful for users. <b><u>(virtually all of this card is taken
                    from</u></b> <a class="external" href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rimtaSgGz_4>

                    As he describes it, platforms start by catering to their
                    users with a service that has some benefit compared to 
                    their competitors. Discord beat Teamspeak
                    because of price and ease of use, Facebook beat MySpace 
                    because people thought Rupert Murdoch was draconican 
                    (Zuck really switched up on that, huh), and Uber beat taxi services
                    because of low price points and how much easier it is to use an
                    app than to <b><i>talk to someone on the phone</i></b> (ðŸ¤®). This is 
                    good business practice. It just <i>makes
                    sense </i>that a better product would (and should) beat a worse one. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem comes with the fact that the platforms are often 
                    <i>losing money </i> to make their product more convenient than
                    the other options (less ads + lower price + extra features = 
                    less revenue & higher costs). So, even though they're getting tons 
                    of users, things need to change if they want to keep the lights on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is when platforms pivot their attention to businesses. 
                </p>

                    <br><br>
                    pivoting their attention from the end user to businesses and 
                    their own pockets.
