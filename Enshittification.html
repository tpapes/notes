                <h1>Enshittification</h1>
                <p>
                    A term coined by Cory Doctorow to describe how the merging 
                    of online platforms makes the internet less attractive 
                    and useful for users. <b><u>(virtually all of this card is taken
                    from</u></b> <a class="external" href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rimtaSgGz_4>

                </p>
                <p>
                    As he describes it, platforms start by catering to their
                    users with a service that has <a class="internal live" href="Competitive Business Strategies.html">
                    some benefit compared to their competitors.</a> This is 
                    good business practice, <a class="internal live" href="Competition Breeds Innovation.html">
                    is great for consumers,</a> and it just <i>makes
                    sense </i>that a better product would (and should) beat a worse one. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The problem comes with the fact that the platforms are often 
                    <a class="internal live" href="Operating at a Loss.html"><i>losing money </i>
                    to make their product more convenient than
                    the other options.</a> So, even though they're getting tons 
                    of users, things need to change if they want to keep the lights on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is when platforms pivot their attention to businesses.
